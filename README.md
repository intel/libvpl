# Intel® Video Processing Library (Intel® VPL)

Intel® Video Processing Library (Intel® VPL) provides access to hardware
accelerated video decode, encode, and processing capabilities on Intel®
GPUs to support AI visual inference, media delivery, cloud gaming, and virtual
desktop infrastructure use cases.

See the [specification](https://intel.github.io/libvpl) for additional information.

This repository contains the following components:

- Copies of the Intel® VPL API header files. The version of the API is listed in
the [mfxdefs.h](./api/vpl/mfxdefs.h) file.
- Intel® VPL Dispatcher
- Examples demonstrating API usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Intel® VPL Tools are no longer in this repository. They have all been moved to
> https://github.com/intel/libvpl-tools

To use Intel® VPL for video processing you need to install at least one
implementation. Here is a list:

- [Intel® VPL GPU Runtime](https://github.com/intel/vpl-gpu-rt) for use on
  Intel® Iris® Xe graphics and newer
- [Intel® Media SDK](https://github.com/Intel-Media-SDK/MediaSDK) for use on
  legacy Intel® graphics

## Architecture

As shown in this diagram, the Intel® VPL Dispatcher forwards function calls from
the application to use the selected runtime.

For TGL and DG1, if both Intel® VPL and Intel® Media SDK runtime are installed
then the Intel® VPL Dispatcher will prefer Intel® VPL runtime unless the
application requests D3D9 by setting the filter property
"mfxImplDescription.AccelerationMode" to MFX_ACCEL_MODE_VIA_D3D9.

## Installing Intel® VPL

### Installation options

Intel® VPL may be installed:

- from source code.  See install and use instructions at
  [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
- from Linux packages.  See [Intel® software for general purpose GPU
  capabilities](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/)


## Using Intel® VPL

### Configure your shell environment

If you did not install to standard system locations, you need to set up the
environment, so tools like CMake and pkg-config can find the library and
headers.

For Linux:
```
source <vpl-install-location>/etc/vpl/vars.sh
```

For Windows:
```
<vpl-install-location>\etc\vpl\vars.bat
```

### Link to Intel® VPL with CMake

Add the following code to your CMakeLists, assuming TARGET is defined as the
component that wants to use Intel® VPL:

```
if(WIN32 AND CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 4)
 set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE x86)
endif()
find_package(VPL REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(${TARGET} VPL::dispatcher)
```


### Link to Intel® VPL from Bash with pkg-config

The following command line illustrates how to link a simple program to Intel®
VPL using pkg-config.

```
gcc program.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs vpl`
```

## Backward Compatibility

No code changes may be introduced that would regress support for any currently supported hardware.
All contributions must ensure continued compatibility and functionality across all supported hardware platforms.
Failure to maintain hardware compatibility may result in the rejection or reversion of the contribution.

Any deliberate modifications or removal of hardware support will be transparently communicated in the release notes.

API options are solely considered as a stable interface.
Any debug parameters, environmental variables, and internal data structures, are not considered as an interface and may be changed or removed at any time.
